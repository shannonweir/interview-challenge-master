# BP3 Coding Exercise
Thank you for participating in the BP3 Coding Exercise. This is a small project captures the essence of the type of
work that we do here at BP3.It's made up of two separate  exercises: one for Java and another for Angular. 
Please complete both of the exercises.

## Project Layout
There are a couple of directories to note:
* `backend` is the Java version of the exercise
* `data` contains the JSON data files used in the exercise
* `docs` contains the `2022 Coding Challenge.pdf` that details the requirements of the exercise
* `frontend` is the Angular version of the exercise

See the `README` in either the `backend` or `frontend` directories for more information on that version of the 
exercise.
